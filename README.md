[00:09.34] I think he knows
[00:11.08] His footprints on the sidewalk
[00:14.05] Lead to where I can't stop
[00:16.33] Go there every night
[00:19.13] I think he knows
[00:20.68] His hands around a cold glass
[00:23.65] Make me wanna know that
[00:26.05] Body like it's mine
[00:35.55] 
[00:29.27] He got that boyish look that I like in a man
[00:32.12] I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
[00:34.61] It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
[00:36.71] No one understands
[00:45.71] 
[00:38.54] He got my heartbeat
[00:41.26] Skipping down 16th Avenue
[00:43.42] Got that, ah, I mean
[00:45.92] Wanna see what's under that attitude, like
[00:49.13] I want you, bless my soul
[00:51.71] And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
[00:55.07] I think he knows
[01:03.07] 
[00:59.62] I think he knows
[01:01.63] When we get all alone
[01:04.03] I'll make myself at home
[01:06.38] And he'll want me to stay
[01:09.65] I think he knows
[01:10.99] He'd better lock it down
[01:13.35] Or I won't stick around
[01:15.79] 'Cause good ones never wait (ha)
[01:31.79] 
[01:19.98] He got that boyish look that I like in a man
[01:22.88] I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
[01:25.18] He's so obsessed with me and boy, I understand
[01:27.20] Boy, I understand
[01:35.70] 
[01:28.93] He got my heartbeat (heartbeat)
[01:32.17] Skipping down 16th Avenue
[01:34.06] Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
[01:36.56] Wanna see what's under that attitude, like
[01:39.51] I want you, bless my soul
[01:42.24] And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
[01:45.52] I think he knows
[01:53.52] 
[01:47.27] I want you, bless my
[01:49.31] I want you, bless my
[01:51.65] I want you, bless my
[01:54.18] I want you, bless my soul
[02:06.68] 
[01:56.33] Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
[01:58.99] We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
[02:01.05] Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
[02:03.56] We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
[02:05.81] "So where we gonna go?"
[02:08.98] I whisper in the dark
[02:11.87] "Where we gonna go?"
[02:13.20] I think he knows
[02:21.20] 
[02:14.71] He got my heartbeat (heartbeat)
[02:17.50] Skipping down 16th Avenue (skipping down 16th)
[02:20.02] Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
[02:22.19] Wanna see what's under that attitude, like (yeah)
[02:25.16] I want you, bless my soul
[02:27.52] And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
[02:30.94] I think he knows
[02:38.94] 
[02:32.65] I want you, bless my
[02:34.40] I want you, bless my (soul)
[02:37.01] I want you, bless my (oh, baby)
[02:39.34] I want you, bless my
[02:41.90] I want you, bless my (he got my heartbeat)
[02:44.84] I want you, bless my (skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)
[02:47.12] I want you, bless my soul
[02:49.37] And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
